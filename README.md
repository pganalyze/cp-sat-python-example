# CP-SAT Python Example

This is the complete source code of the [CP-SAT](https://developers.google.com/optimization/cp/cp_solver) example described in this [blog post](https://pganalyze.com/blog/a-practical-introduction-to-constraint-programming-using-cp-sat). In this example, a constraint programming model describes a work schedule for the employees of a small store.

## Requirements

Python 3.8+ is required, as well as `ortools` 9.9+:

```bash
$ python -m pip install ortools>=9.9
```

## Try it

Running the model is as simple as:

```bash
$ python shift_schedule.py
```

Try it for yourself and tweak the schedule!
